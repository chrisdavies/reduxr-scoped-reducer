## reduxr-scoped-reducer

A utility to create Redux reducers which only respond to prefixed actions.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chrisdavies/reduxr-scoped-reducer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chrisdavies/reduxr-scoped-reducer)

## Usage

Say we have a reducer that looks like this:

```js
import objReducer from 'reduxr-scoped-reducer';

export default objReducer({}, {
  user_setName: (state, {name}) => ({...state, name}),
  user_setAge: (state, {age}) => ({...state, age})
});

```

It responds to `user_` actions. Instead of having to type `user_` over and
over, we can instead scope the reducer as shown below:

```js
// user-reducer.js
import objReducer from 'reduxr-obj-reducer';

// Note the reducer functions are no longer prefixed with user_
export default objReducer({}, {
  setName: (state, {name}) => ({...state, name}),
  setAge: (state, {age}) => ({...state, age})
});

// reducers.js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import scopedReducer from 'reduxr-scoped-reducer';
import user from './user-reducer';

export default combineReducers({
  // This only passes user_ actions down to the user reducer, and takes the
  // user_ prefix off of the action type when it does.
  user: scopedReducer('user_', user)
});
```

At first glance, this may not seem super useful, but it has proven to be
very handy when dealing with refactoring, or when dealing with really common
reducer patterns (e.g. filters on lists), allowing us to reuse a reducer
definition, but apply it to a different set of actions.
